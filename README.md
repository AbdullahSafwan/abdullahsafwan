## About Me

<div align="center">

**Software Engineer, Backend** | Node.js | TypeScript | AWS

</div>
I'm a passionate Backend Software Engineer currently working at Diya Interactive, where I specialize in building scalable serverless applications using Node.js, TypeScript, and AWS. I love architecting robust backend systems and diving deep into media streaming technologies.

Currently working on a B2C application with Serverless Framework, Prisma, and MySQL. Before that, I built audio/video streaming systems using AWS Media Services. I also help mentor junior engineers when I'm not debugging my own code.

Graduated with a B.E in Computer Systems Engineering from DUET Karachi
