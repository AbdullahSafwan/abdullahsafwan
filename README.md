## About Me

I'm a passionate Backend Software Engineer currently working at **Diya Interactive**, where I specialize in building scalable serverless applications using Node.js, TypeScript, and AWS. I love architecting robust backend systems and diving deep into media streaming technologies.

Currently working on a B2C application with Serverless Framework, Prisma, and MySQL. Before that, I built audio/video streaming systems using AWS Media Services. I also help mentor junior engineers when I'm not debugging my own code.

Graduated with a B.E in Computer Systems Engineering from DUET Karachi. You can reach me at **abdullahsafwan768@gmail.com**
